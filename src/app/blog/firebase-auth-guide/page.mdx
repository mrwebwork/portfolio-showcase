  Prerequisites and Project Setup
</h1>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  Before diving in, ensure Node.js is installed on your local machine. This can
  be downloaded from the Node.js official website. Once installed, we'll begin
  by setting up a new Next.js app using the npx create-next-app@latest command
  in your terminal. Follow the setup prompts, opting for the App recommended
  option and not the src folder option.
</p>

<p className="text-xl">
  Next, install Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and then run npm update to keep everything
  up-to-date. Once all installations are complete, kickstart your development
  server with npm run dev, ensuring to use nvm use v18 for the correct Node
  version.
</p>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  Note: Always remember to shut down the server when installing packages to
  avoid any errors.
</p>

<br />

  Project Configuration: Cleaning and Coding
</h1>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  Our project will need some tweaking to fit our needs. This involves removing
  certain files and code sections, followed by adding some. For instance, you
  will need to clear out the main tag element in the page.js file and add a div
  and a h1 with a title of your choice.
</p>

<p className="text-xl">
  In addition, you will need to add certain codes, and add all the btn classes
  to the global.css file. Always remember to update the metadata in layout.js
  with your own information.
</p>
<br />

<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold xl:text-3xl">
  Setting up Firebase in Next.js
</h1>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  Here's where it gets even more exciting! Firebase, a Backend-as-a-Service,
  offers services like authentication, database, storage, and hosting. For our
  project, we'll focus on authentication and database.
</p>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  After creating a new project on Firebase Console, we'll enable Firebase
  Hosting and install the Firebase SDK in our CLI using npm install firebase.
  The process involves setting up Firebase in our Next.js app using a
  firebaseConfig object, and deploying the app to Firebase Hosting.
</p>

<br />
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold xl:text-3xl">
  Setting up Firebase Authentication & Creating Protected Pages
</h1>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  Firebase Authentication allows users to sign up using their email and
  password. The onAuthStateChanged() function allows us to create protected
  pages that are only accessible to logged-in users. By utilizing the React
  Context API, we can share state with other components, allowing us to create
  an efficient authentication process.
</p>

<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold xl:text-3xl">
  Optional: Success & Error Handling with React Hot Toast
</h1>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  To wrap it up, we'll install React Hot Toast which allows us to display
  notifications seamlessly in our React app. This tool is instrumental in
  handling success and error messages and helps improve the overall user
  experience.
</p>
<br />
<p className="text-xl">
  By following these steps, you're well on your way to setting up a full-stack
  app using Next.js and Firebase. This tutorial should equip you with the
  fundamental skills needed to create a robust and efficient web application.
  Happy coding!
