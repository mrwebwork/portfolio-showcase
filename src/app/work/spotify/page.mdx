<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Overview</h1>

<p className="py-6 text-lg">
  Built with Next.js and React, the application ensures a seamless, single-page
  experience. It features a sleek and responsive interface, crafted using
  Tailwind CSS, to emulate the acclaimed UI of Spotify. The interface is fully
  responsive, providing compatibility across all devices.
</p>
<p className="pb-6 text-lg">
  For authentication, the application utilizes Supabase, a modern alternative to
  Firebase. Supabase enables secure user registration and login processes,
  including OAuth via Github. Additionally, it offers powerful database
  management capabilities, allowing the creation of schemas and data
  manipulation using PostgreSQL.
</p>
<p className="pb-6 text-lg">
  The application also integrates with Stripe, enabling premium subscriptions
  within the platform. It handles recurring payments, subscription management,
  and service cancellations efficiently.
</p>
<p className="pb-6 text-lg">
  Key features include efficient song upload management, creation and management
  of playlists, favoriting songs, and an interactive music player. Supabase
  storage supports file and image uploads, while react-hook-form and react-toast
  handle form validation and error handling.
</p>
<p className="pb-6 text-lg">
  Data fetching in server React components directly accesses the database,
  eliminating the need for an API. The project also demonstrates route handling
  for POST, GET, and DELETE requests, and manages relations between Server and
  Child components in real-time environments.
